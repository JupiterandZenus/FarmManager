# Docker Hub Deployment Summary

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Fixes
- Fixed the `updated_at` column in all tables to have the correct default value: `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(3) ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(3)`
- Verified that all required tables are created: `accounts`, `account_categories`, `proxies`, `proxy_categories`, `agents`, `bots`, `tasks`
- Database connection is working properly from the application

### 2. CPU Manager Fixes
- Created a simplified CPU manager script (`cpu_manager_simple.sh`) to avoid dependency issues
- Updated the supervisord configuration to use the correct path to the CPU manager script
- CPU manager is now running successfully and reporting proper system statistics

### 3. Supervisord Configuration Fixes
- Fixed environment variables format in supervisord.conf
- All services are now starting properly and running as expected

## Current Status

### Working Components
- MariaDB database is running and accessible
- All database tables are created with proper schema

### Issues to Address
- Web interface (port 3333) is not accessible from the host
- noVNC interface (port 8081) is not accessible from the host

## Next Steps
1. Investigate network/firewall issues that might be preventing access to the web interfaces
2. Test the EternalFarm API integration (currently getting 401 Unauthorized errors)
3. Update the Docker image on Docker Hub with any additional fixes
