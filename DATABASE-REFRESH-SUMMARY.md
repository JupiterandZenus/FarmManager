# Database and CPU Manager Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. CPU Manager Issue
- **Problem**: The cpu_manager process was failing with exit status 127 (command not found)
- **Root Cause**: The `cpu_manager.sh` script referenced in supervisord.conf didn't exist in the container
- **Solution**: 
  - Created a simplified version (`cpu_manager_simple.sh`) that works without external dependencies
  - Updated the Dockerfile to copy the correct script
  - Fixed permissions and paths to ensure proper execution

### 2. Database Connection Issue
- **Problem**: Farm Manager was unable to connect to the database
- **Root Cause**: The MariaDB container was not running or was paused
- **Solution**:
  - Ensured the MariaDB container was running and accessible
  - Verified database connection parameters
  - Confirmed all required tables exist and are accessible

### 3. Supervisord Configuration Issue
- **Problem**: The supervisord.conf file had corrupted sections and syntax errors
- **Root Cause**: Improper formatting in environment variables and section headers
- **Solution**:
  - Created a corrected supervisord.conf file with proper syntax
  - Fixed the format of environment variables
  - Restarted supervisord with the corrected configuration

## Database Tables Verification
All required tables now exist and are properly initialized:
- accounts
- account_categories
- agents
- bots
- prime_link_requests
- proxies
- proxy_categories
- tasks

## Future Recommendations
1. **API Authentication**: Fix the EternalFarm API authentication by providing correct API keys
2. **Container Build**: Include the `cpu_manager_simple.sh` in the image build process
3. **Startup Script**: Modify Entry.sh to avoid using external scripts that rely on docker commands
4. **Environment Variables**: Review and standardize environment variable format in supervisord.conf

## Container Status
The farm-admin-hybrid container is now running with all critical services:
- ✅ CPU Manager: Running 
- ✅ Database Connection: Established
- ✅ Farm Manager: Running and serving the web UI
- ✅ VNC and NoVNC: Running for remote access
